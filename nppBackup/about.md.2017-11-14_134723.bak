# Frank Hyunsok Oh (오현석, 吳賢錫)

I am a programmer at JNFSoft and a Technical Translator(English to Korean), currently I'm mainly on an exciting unltrasound HIFU(high intensity focused ultrasound) project using CEF(Chromium Embedded Framework), HTML with react.js frontend, node.js based middleware, and C++ backend for controlling the ultrasound devices.
